# Bamazon
A Node.js command line app that uses a mySQL database to store information.

## Description 

Bamazon App is a CLI (Command Line Interface) App built using NodeJS, and utilizes a mySQL database to store and update information. The App allows users to "purchase" available items, as long as there is enough quantity available, and let's them know how much those items cost. The code also updates the database, so the next user won't be able to purchase anything if there isn't enough quantity. Checkout the video below for a walkthrough.
